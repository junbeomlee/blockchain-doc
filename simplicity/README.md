## Simplicity

[Simplicity: A New Language for blockchains](https://blockstream.com/simplicity.pdf)

Simplicity is a typed, combinator-based, functional language without loops and recursion, designed to be used for crypto-currency languages and blockchain applications. It aims to improve upon existing crypto-currency languages, such as Bitcoin Script and Ethereum's EVM, while avoiding some of the problems they face.



Problems with EVM

- Difficult to assign costs to operations.
- Difficult to bound the costs of programs.
- Complex and informal language semantics makes reasoning difficult.



Problems with Bitcoin

- Bitcoin's programming language is too inexpressives
